# Neural-Network

In this I have written some python scripts to understand neural network. #tryingtounderstandneuralnetwork

But first you need to download data from University of Toronto Website (just google cifar10 toronto).
And then in cifar10.py add path to the directory which contain data file which you just downloaded.
